# Introduction
A few weeks ago, I was asked to look into static code analysis, mainly with the tool
nDepend. I had never had any experience with static code analysis yet, and was fairly
curious about what this was all about. 

In this blogpost I will be talking about what static code analysis is, what the 
difference is with dynamic code analysis and when to use it. After that I will be 
talking about some metrics and conclusions you can get from a static code analysis
tool and I will be ending my post with a small overview what nDepend has to offer.
